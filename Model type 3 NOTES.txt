Model type 3

Set H2O, CO2, S ranges (for MI)

1. Generate dictionaries with every combo of MI volatile values possible

2. Calculate fluid from differenced MI
	Using Difference_MI_volailtes method
		Store in Degassed_MI_deep_to_shallow dict
			Deep wt% majors
			Differenced wt% volatiles

3. Convert wt% to mole fraction
	Using Convert_wt_to_molfrac
		Store in DegassedMI_X
			Deep majors in X
			Deep dissolved volatiles in X
			Fluid comp volatiles in X

4. Store fluid comp volatiles in X in MeltInclusion_deep_thermo
	MeltInclusion_deep_thermo now contains:
		press (highP)
		temp in C
		logfO2
		temp in K
		press (low P)
		XH2Ofl
		XCO2fl
		XSfl

5. Run the model on MeltInclusion_deep_thermo
	Store to Normd_fluid
		Here is what the model does....
			1. Calculate fO2 using fO2_from_dQFM
			2. Calculate all gammas
			3. Calculate all log Ks
			4. Calculate K from log K
			5. Respeciate the fluid comp using respeciate(thermo, 1)
				Here is what respeciate does...
					1. Calculates XHtot, XStot, XCtot, XOtot
					2. Calculates fH2 and fS2 using fsolve, two eqns, two unknowls (eqn 9 in Iacovino, 2015)
					3. Calculate fCO (eqn 10 in Iacovino, 2015)
					4. Calculate fCO2 using calc'd fCO and known fO2
					5. calculate fSO2 using calc'd fS2 and known fO2
					6. Calculate fH2S using calc'd fH2 and fS2 values
					7. Calculate fH2O using calc'd fH2 and known fO2
					9. Calculate all X's from f's
					8. Store these in MeltInclusion_deep_thermo
						MeltInclusion_deep_thermo now contains:
							press (highP)
							temp in C
							logfO2
							temp in K
							press (low P)
							XH2Ofl
							XCO2fl
							XSfl
							fO2 low
							all gammas
							all log K's
							all K's
							all f's (from respeciate)
							all X's (called form within respeciate, which is dumb. Change this.)
